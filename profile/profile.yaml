    description: "Had a Linux cluster of nodes/servers running CentOS 7 and internally connected through a switch. The project aimed to provide a monitoring agent which records hardware specifications of cluster nodes and monitors their resource usage in real-time. Used by Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to have a better insight into servers, and their usage to meet the business requirements. Technologies deployed in the project: Bash scripting, SQL, Git, GCP, and Docker."

        Technologies deployed in this project: JDBC, PSQL, Maven, slf4j, Docker, and Git."
      - "Grep App: Developed a project that implements Linux grep usage in java. Java Grep application searches for a user-specified pattern in all the files of a given directory and outputs the matched lines into a file.
        Technologies deployed in this project: Core Java, Stream APIs, Lambda, slf4j logging API, Maven, Shade plugin, Docker, and Git."

    #URL is optional

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Proposed a new image aggregation scheme in WVSNs. Designed a two-tier network architecture in which camera-equipped sensors with less energy were located in the lower tier to communicate with the environment. In this scheme, clustering, as well as P2P frameworks, were used and the data including the number and types of objects were extracted from the images (using the image filtering and processing methods) in a distributed in-network processing structure. Finally, the fused scalar data was sent back to the base station. The results showed this new scheme can reduce the network traffic and communication energy consumption and hence, increase overall network lifetime."
