# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I have completed an MSc in computer engineering at Shahid Beheshti University in Iran. I am a performance-driven and result-oriented developer with more than 5 years of experience in designing databases and project management in automation projects (BPMS). I have expertise in leading engineering teams to achieve concrete goals on a strict deadline. I also have one year of working experience in developing backend components and implementing RESTful APIs in Django to support the platform's frontend. Recently, I joined Jarvis as a software developer and collaborated on various projects including but not limited to developing a cluster monitoring agent, Java grep app, Twitter app and a trading app using Springboot framework. I have strong skills in Java, SQL, Python, Django, docker and also working knowledge of UI development and frontend technologies. I am seeking to leverage my expertise and knowledge to work on challenging problems and enhance product capabilities.

    description: "Developed a bash monitoring agent which records hardware specifications of cluster nodes and monitors their resource usage in real-time in a Linux cluster of nodes/servers running CentOS 7 and internally connected through a switch. The application is utilized by the Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team to have a better insight into servers, and their usage to meet the business requirements. The application is implemented in Bash scripts, SQL, and PostgreSQL. Used docker and crontab to deploy the application. Github was used for source code management."

      - "Twitter App: Implemented a Java application using Twitter REST APIs and Http Client to allow users to 1) post a new tweet with a geotag, 2) search for a tweet by id and filter the response fields, 3) delete a list of Tweets by their ids. The application is implemented using MVC design pattern and consists of Models, Controller Layer, Service Layer and Data Access Layer components. Used JUnit4 and Mockito to test the application and SpringBoot for dependency management. Represented tweet objects in JSON format using JSON library. Used docker to deploy the application, and Github to manage the source code."
      - "JDBC App: Designed a Java application that implements CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations using JDBC API and DAO design pattern to access and manipulate data in a relational database. The application is implemented in Java and PostgreSQL. Used Maven and slf4j for logging purposes. Github was used for source code management."
      - "Grep App: Developed a project that implements Linux grep usage in java. Java Grep application searches for a user-specified pattern in all the files of a given directory and outputs the matched lines into a file. The application is implemented in Java. Used Stream APIs and Lambda to improve the performance and enable processing of big files. Used docker to deploy the application, and Github to manage the source code."

    description: Proposed a new image aggregation scheme in WVSNs. Designed a two-tier network architecture in which camera-equipped sensors with less energy were located in the lower tier to communicate with the environment. In this scheme, clustering, as well as P2P frameworks, were used and the data including the number and types of objects were extracted from the images (using the image filtering and processing methods) in a distributed in-network processing structure. Finally, the fused scalar data was sent back to the base station. The results showed this new scheme can reduce the network traffic and communication energy consumption and hence, increase overall network lifetime.
